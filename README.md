# Work-Day-Scheduler

# URL

# Description
Created a daily planner to allow you to input your daily
activities or to do list for the hours of 9am-5pm.

# Usage
Each hour contains a text box where reminders can
be inserted and saved. Once saved the information
will remain on the text box. The text box color 
will update based on the hour of the day. For example,
Red = "current hour", Green = "future hour", and Grey = "past hour".
At 6pm each day your calendar will refresh.
